# Computer Vision Projects – CNNs, VLMs, and Object Detection

## Overview
This section contains three core computer vision labs covering Convolutional Neural Networks, Visual Language Models, and Object Detection. These projects apply deep learning techniques for classification, multimodal reasoning, and bounding box detection.

## Objectives
- Understand how CNNs extract visual features  
- Explore multimodal AI through CLIP and BLIP  
- Perform object detection using transfer learning  
- Learn how deep learning models can be evaluated and improved  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- TensorFlow / TensorFlow Hub  
- PyTorch (for CLIP / BLIP paths)  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Open any notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Install required libraries:
```python
!pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib seaborn torch torchvision
