# 🔴 3. README – COMPUTER VISION 


# Computer Vision Projects – CNNs, VLMs, and Object Detection

## Overview
This section contains three core computer vision labs covering Convolutional Neural Networks, Visual Language Models, and Object Detection. These projects apply deep learning techniques for classification, multimodal reasoning, and bounding box detection.

## Objectives
- Understand how CNNs extract visual features  
- Explore multimodal AI through CLIP and BLIP  
- Perform object detection using transfer learning  
- Learn how deep learning models can be evaluated and improved  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- TensorFlow / TensorFlow Hub  
- PyTorch (for CLIP / BLIP paths)  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Open any notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Install required libraries:
!pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib seaborn torch torchvision
3. For Object Detection, enable GPU in Colab:
4. Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU

Run all cells in sequence

## Results

Lab 05 (CNN): Achieved classification accuracy on “Chihuahua vs Muffin,” visualized filters and misclassifications

Lab 08 (VLMs): Performed zero-shot classification, generated captions, executed VQA, and analyzed embeddings

Object Detection: Fine-tuned SSD MobileNet, produced bounding boxes on Pascal VOC–style images

## Key Learnings

How convolutional layers detect patterns across spatial dimensions

How VLMs integrate text and image embeddings

How transfer learning accelerates object detection performance

Practical challenges such as dataset handling, GPU usage, and model evaluation

## My Role in These Computer Vision Projects

Across these labs, I was responsible for:

- Designing and implementing convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision-language model (VLM) notebooks end to end  
- Preparing image datasets and performing preprocessing such as resizing, normalization, and augmentations  
- Training, validating, and evaluating CNNs, object detection models, and VLMs (CLIP / BLIP)  
- Running transfer learning workflows with TensorFlow Hub and Pascal VOC  
- Visualizing detection outputs, attention maps, similarity matrices, and classification results  
- Documenting findings, interpreting accuracy, loss curves, bounding-box metrics, and explaining model limitations
