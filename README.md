# José Tuozzo – Applied AI Portfolio

## About Me
I am an Applied Artificial Intelligence student at Houston Community College, focusing on computer vision, machine learning, and practical AI applications. This portfolio brings together the main projects I have worked on during my studies and shows how I apply AI to real-world problems.

I enjoy building hands-on projects where I can go from raw data to a working model, analyze results, and iterate to improve performance.

## Technical Skills
- Programming: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab)
- Machine Learning: supervised learning, regression, classification, model evaluation
- Deep Learning: basic CNNs for image classification and object detection
- Computer Vision: OpenCV, image preprocessing, object detection workflows
- NLP: basic text preprocessing, sentiment analysis
- Tools & Platforms: GitHub, Google Colab, Jupyter, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (where applicable)

## Featured Courses & Projects

### Computer Vision (ITAI 1378)
- [SmartInventoryCounter – Object Detection for Inventory](ComputerVision-ITAI1378/SmartInventoryCounter-ObjectDetection/README.md)  
  A computer vision project that uses an object detection model to count items in images for inventory support.

### Machine Learning & Data Science
- [House Prices Regression Model](MachineLearning-Projects/HousePrices-Regression/README.md)  
  A regression project that predicts house prices using multiple features and compares different models.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- [Sentiment Analysis of Reviews](NLP-Projects/Sentiment-Analysis/README.md)  
  A project that classifies text reviews as positive or negative using basic NLP techniques.

## How This Portfolio Is Organized

- `ComputerVision-ITAI1378/` – Computer vision course projects  
- `MachineLearning-Projects/` – Machine learning and regression/classification projects  
- `NLP-Projects/` – Natural language processing projects  
- `Presentation/` – Optional portfolio presentation (PDF)

Each course folder contains:
- A course-level README with a short overview
- One or more project folders
- Each project folder has its own README, notebook, and results
