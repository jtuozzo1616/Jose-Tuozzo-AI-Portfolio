# José Tuozzo – Applied AI & Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About Me
I am an Applied Artificial Intelligence student at Houston Community College with hands-on experience in computer vision, machine learning, and AI-related cybersecurity. My work spans practical AI engineering (object detection, regression modeling) and AI security topics such as zero-click vulnerabilities, AI agent threat models, SOC/DFIR workflows, and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.

This portfolio includes real projects developed during my coursework.

## Technical Skills
### Artificial Intelligence
- Python, Jupyter, Google Colab  
- Machine Learning (Regression, Classification)  
- Deep Learning (CNNs, Object Detection, YOLO workflow basics)  
- Computer Vision (OpenCV, bounding boxes, dataset preprocessing)

### Cybersecurity
- Zero-click attack vectors & exploitation flow  
- AI Security: prompt injection, model exfiltration, poisoning, jailbreak risks  
- Threat modeling for AI agents  
- SOC / DFIR fundamentals  
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage)
