# 📉 House Prices Regression – Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This machine learning project predicts housing prices using numerical and categorical features. Multiple regression models were trained and compared to evaluate which approach best fits the dataset and produces the most accurate predictions.

## Objectives

- Build end-to-end regression models for price prediction  
- Practice data preprocessing, encoding, and feature selection  
- Compare performance across different ML algorithms  
- Understand evaluation metrics used in predictive modeling  

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install required libraries (if needed):

   !pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


4. Run all cells in order.

5. Review model metrics, plots, and analysis outputs.

## Results 

    Compared MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² across multiple regression models

    Identified the best-performing regressor using validation data

    Visualized prediction errors and feature impacts through plots and summary statistics

    (Optional to add, if quieres)
    The best model achieved an R² of approximately X.XX on the validation set, with a relatively low MAE and stable error distribution.

## Key Learnings

    Differences between linear and non-linear regression models

    How to evaluate and select models based on statistical metrics

    Importance of preprocessing and feature engineering for ML performance

## My Role in This Machine Learning Project

In the House Prices Regression project, I was responsible for:

    - Designing and implementing the full machine learning workflow notebook

   -  Cleaning, filtering, and preparing the housing dataset features

    - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand correlations and trends

    - Training and comparing multiple regression models using scikit-learn

    - Evaluating performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²

    - Visualizing model outputs, prediction errors, and feature importance

    - Writing a technical analysis explaining results, trade-offs, and model selection decisions

  ## Note: The dataset used in this project is referenced in the notebook. Dataset source, loading method, and preprocessing steps are documented directly inside the notebook and not uploaded as raw files to this repository.
