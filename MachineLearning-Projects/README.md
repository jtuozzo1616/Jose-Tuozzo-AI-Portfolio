# 🟢 **2. README – MACHINE LEARNING (HOUSE PRICES REGRESSION)**  

# House Prices Regression – Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This machine learning project predicts housing prices using numerical and categorical features. Multiple regression models were trained and compared to evaluate which approach best fits the dataset and produces the most accurate predictions.

## Objectives
- Learn how to build end-to-end regression models  
- Practice data preprocessing, encoding, and feature selection  
- Compare performance across different ML algorithms  
- Understand evaluation metrics used in predictive modeling  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Install required libraries:
!pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
3. Run all cells in order
4. Review model metrics and plots

## Results

Compared MAE, MSE, and R² across multiple models

Identified the best-performing regressor using validation data

Visualized prediction errors and feature impacts

##  Key Learnings

Differences between linear and non-linear regression models

How to evaluate and select models based on statistical metrics

Importance of preprocessing for ML performance
