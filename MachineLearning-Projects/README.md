# 🟢 **2. README – MACHINE LEARNING (HOUSE PRICES REGRESSION)**  

# House Prices Regression – Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This machine learning project predicts housing prices using numerical and categorical features. Multiple regression models were trained and compared to evaluate which approach best fits the dataset and produces the most accurate predictions.

## Objectives
- Learn how to build end-to-end regression models  
- Practice data preprocessing, encoding, and feature selection  
- Compare performance across different ML algorithms  
- Understand evaluation metrics used in predictive modeling  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Install required libraries:
```python
!pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
