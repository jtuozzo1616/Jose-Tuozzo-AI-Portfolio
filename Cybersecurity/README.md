### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Data Analysis – Foundations (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Overview

This section contains three introductory data analysis projects designed to build core skills essential for cybersecurity workflows. Each notebook focuses on a foundational tool—Pandas, Matplotlib, or Seaborn—used for exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting datasets that could represent logs, alerts, or security events.

## Objectives

- Learn how to manipulate and analyze structured data using Pandas  
- Build visualizations to detect trends or anomalies relevant to cybersecurity  
- Understand how to summarize patterns through statistical graphics  
- Develop the analytical foundation required for threat detection and incident analysis  

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Open each notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install required libraries (if needed):

   !pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.

4. Review outputs such as tables, graphs, and summary statistics.

## Results 

- Pandas 101: demonstrated dataset loading, cleaning, filtering, grouping, and basic aggregation

- Matplotlib 101: generated bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots to explore trends and distributions

Seaborn 101: produced heatmaps, histograms, and pairplots for deeper statistical insight

## Key Learnings

- How to preprocess and structure real-world datasets

- How visualization assists in detecting unusual patterns in security-related data

- How to interpret distributions, correlations, and trends

## My Role in These Cybersecurity Data Analysis Projects

In these foundational data-science-for-cybersecurity exercises, I was responsible for:

- Implementing each notebook end to end using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

- Loading and cleaning datasets, correcting formats, and exploring statistical properties

- Creating visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pairplots

- Interpreting results in the context of data analysis and potential cybersecurity insights

- Documenting findings clearly and explaining the purpose of each visualization

- Ensuring each notebook is readable, reproducible, and aligned with academic best practices
