# Cybersecurity Data Analysis – Foundations (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Overview
This section contains three introductory data analysis projects designed to build core skills essential for cybersecurity workflows. Each notebook focuses on a foundational tool—Pandas, Matplotlib, or Seaborn—used for exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and interpreting datasets that could represent logs, alerts, or security events.

## Objectives
- Learn how to manipulate and analyze structured data using Pandas  
- Build visualizations to detect trends or anomalies relevant to cybersecurity  
- Understand how to summarize patterns through statistical graphics  
- Develop the analytical foundation required for threat detection and incident analysis  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Install required libraries:
```python
!pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
