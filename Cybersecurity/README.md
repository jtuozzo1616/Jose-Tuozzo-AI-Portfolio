# Data Fundamentals – Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

This folder contains essential data analysis and visualization fundamentals used across all machine learning and AI projects. These notebooks demonstrate core skills needed to understand, explore, and visualize datasets effectively.

The goal of this section is to show competency in the three foundational Python libraries for data science:

- **Pandas** → Data loading, cleaning, filtering, grouping  
- **Matplotlib** → Basic plotting and figure customization  
- **Seaborn** → Statistical visualizations and exploratory data analysis  

These notebooks form the base of any machine learning workflow and demonstrate your ability to work with real datasets.

## 📘 1. Pandas 101

### What you learn
- Reading CSV files  
- Checking dataset structure (`head`, `tail`, `info`, `describe`)  
- Selecting columns and filtering rows  
- Handling missing values  
- GroupBy operations  
- Basic statistics and aggregations  

### Files included
- `Pandas101.ipynb` *(or `.py`, depending on your final upload)*  
- Optional: interpretation or output text files  
- Example dataset (if required)

Pandas is the backbone of data preprocessing for ML, so this notebook shows your ability to prepare data before modeling.

## 📙 2. Matplotlib 101

### What you learn
- Line charts  
- Bar charts  
- Scatter plots  
- Customizing titles, labels, colors  
- Saving figures to file  

### Files included
- `Matplotlib101.ipynb`

Matplotlib is the base plotting library in Python and is used everywhere in ML and CV for visualizing metrics, results, and training curves.

## 📗 3. Seaborn 101

### What you learn
- Distribution plots (histograms, KDE)  
- Boxplots and violin plots  
- Heatmaps  
- Pairplots for feature relationships  
- Styling and themes  

### Files included
- `Seaborn101.ipynb`

Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and is used to quickly identify statistical patterns and correlations that guide ML preprocessing and modeling decisions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder demonstrates that you have strong foundations in data analysis.  
Before building ML models or training neural networks, every AI engineer must be able to:

- Clean data  
- Explore patterns  
- Visualize insights  

This section shows that you can do exactly that.
