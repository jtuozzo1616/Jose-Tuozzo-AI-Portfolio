# Cybersecurity & AI – Concepts and Summaries

This folder contains written work and diagrams related to cybersecurity concepts studied alongside AI, including attack types, risk, and defense strategies.

The focus here is on **understanding security at a high level**, not on exploit coding.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Zero-Click Attacks (Conceptual Overview)
Documents explaining how zero-click attacks work and why they are dangerous:

- Examples such as:
  - MMS-based exploits (media parsing vulnerabilities)
  - VoIP call exploits
  - Malicious messages that trigger bugs without user interaction
- Key ideas:
  - No user action required
  - Attack surface in message parsing and media libraries
  - Importance of patching and sandboxing

You can include:
- A short PDF or markdown summary
- A diagram like `ZeroClick_AttackFlow.png`

### 2. AI Security Threats
High-level explanations of how AI systems can be attacked or abused, for example:

- Prompt injection and jailbreaks for AI assistants
- Data poisoning (corrupting training data)
- Model exfiltration (stealing models via excessive queries)
- Membership inference (guessing if a sample was in the training set)

You can include:
- Summaries
- Diagrams like `AI_Security_Threats.png`

### 3. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)
Notes and diagrams describing:

- **Govern** – policies, roles, and accountability
- **Map** – context, stakeholders, and risk
- **Measure** – evaluation, metrics, testing
- **Manage** – risk responses and continuous improvement

Files might include:
- `NIST_AI_RMF_Notes.md`
- `NIST_AI_RMF_Diagram.png`

### 4. SOC / DFIR Fundamentals
Basic understanding of:

- Security Operations Center (SOC) roles
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Incident response lifecycle:
  - Identification
  - Containment
  - Eradication
  - Recovery
  - Lessons learned

You can include:
- Flowcharts (e.g., `SOC_Incident_Flowchart.png`)
- Short summaries of procedures

## Purpose of This Folder

Even though these are not coding-heavy projects, they show:

- Awareness of modern cyber threats
- Understanding of how AI and security intersect
- Ability to read, summarize, and communicate technical risk

This is useful if you want to show employers that you are not only an AI/ML developer, but also aware of security and risk.
