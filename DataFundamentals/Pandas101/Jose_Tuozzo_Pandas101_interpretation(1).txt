Interpretation (2–3 sentences for the write‑up)

• MS shows a 100% hire rate in this sample, BS about 71.4%, and PhD 50.0%.
• This suggests that, for this dataset, holding a master's degree is associated with the highest likelihood of hire,
  while PhD applicants have the lowest rate among the three groups.
• Because the sample size is small (n=13) and unbalanced by education level, these results should be taken as indicative, not definitive.
