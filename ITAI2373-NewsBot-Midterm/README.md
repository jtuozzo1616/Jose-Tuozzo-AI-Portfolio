# NewsBot Intelligence System — ITAI 2373 Midterm

**Student portfolio:** José Miguel Tuozzo Izaguirre  
**Sole project contributor:** José Miguel Tuozzo Izaguirre  
**Submission status:** Individual / Solo (instructor approval required because the rubric specifies groups of 3–4)  
**Individual public GitHub repository:** `[ADD ACTUAL WORKING URL]`  
**Status:** Developed notebook **not yet executed on the approved data in Colab**. Dataset instructor approval required before submission.

## What this does

An end-to-end **English-language historical-news** NLP workflow intended as an editorial triage prototype. It prepares BBC article text, extracts interpretable lexical features, analyzes grammatical and dependency patterns, scores VADER sentiment and an explicitly heuristic emotion lexicon, evaluates several supervised classifiers, extracts named entities, maps same-article co-mentions, and runs a complete pipeline on newly written test articles. The business applications are desk routing, thematic analysis, entity monitoring, and human-reviewed research.

**Supported categories:** `business`, `entertainment`, `politics`, `sport`, `tech`. This selected dataset **does not cover Health**. The dataset consists of BBC articles from an older period; it is not a modern-news or live-news feed.

## Academic integrity and source rights

- The instructor requires **approval BEFORE USING A KAGGLE DATASET**; `docs/Dataset_Approval_Request.md` is a draft request. Obtain approval before official experiments/submission.
- The dataset is BBC News Classification (Kaggle competition): https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/data . The labeled file is **`BBC News Train.csv`** (1,490 articles) with `ArticleId`, `Text` (sometimes mirrored as `Article`), `Category`.
- The unlabeled competition test set is **not an evaluation set**. We split the labeled file ourselves.
- Kaggle competition rules and BBC rights apply. **Do not add full copyrighted BBC article texts or API credentials to public GitHub.**
- This template and explanations require individual review, actual coding contributions and the student's own analysis/reflection as specified by the teacher. Do not present placeholder contributions or unexecuted metrics as your own empirical work.

## Reproduce in **Google Colab Free**

1. **Get written instructor approval** for the dataset. Download `BBC News Train.csv` from the official Kaggle page after agreeing to its terms. Keep it private/local.
2. Upload the notebook to Colab and the CSV to the Colab **Files** sidebar, in `/content/BBC News Train.csv`. Alternatively set the `DATA_PATH` variable in Module 1 to its actual location. Internet is needed for pip, spaCy small English model, NLTK VADER resource.
3. Select **Runtime → Run all**. On first install, if Colab asks for a runtime restart, restart and run all again. CPU is sufficient; no GPU subscription or secret token is required.
4. Check sample size and the five category counts; read generated TF-IDF/POS/syntax/sentiment/NER plots and actual holdout test scores. The notebook writes files into `outputs/`; download these before Colab storage expires.
5. Verify the confusion matrix, the per-class F1 scores, error excerpts, and execution of **three** new fictional article examples. Document your own analysis of at least three concrete observations and their caveats.
6. Complete the two-page individual reflection with **actual technical decisions, limitations, evidence and individual work**. Do not claim group meetings or peer review. Write the report with the actual outputs and an actual clickable public GitHub link.
7. Publish the notebook and non-copyrighted results in **your individual public portfolio repository**; verify its link while signed out. Obtain the instructor's permission to submit alone and ask whether the two-page reflection should be submitted in the group-reflection slot.

## Design and evaluation controls

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Labeled data | 1,490-row BBC competition training file (subject to cleaning and availability) |
| Data quality | Missing/empty texts; exact-text deduplication; category assertions; word counts |
| Holdout | 80% training / 20% untouched test, stratified, `random_state=42` |
| Model selection | Five-fold stratified **training-only** CV, macro-F1 |
| Models | Dummy, MultinomialNB, LogisticRegression, LinearSVC |
| Hyperparameters | GridSearchCV on training folds for top non-dummy model |
| Feature leakage protection | TF-IDF **inside sklearn Pipeline**; never fitted on held-out test set |
| Performance | Accuracy, macro/weighted F1, per-category precision/recall/F1, confusion matrix, errors |
| Linguistic analysis | spaCy original text, bounded to first 3,500 chars/article for speed |
| NER relationships | Same-article co-mentions only, no claim of causality |
| Sentiment | VADER full article, descriptive polarity, not objectivity measure |
| Emotions | Transparent dictionary *proxy*, **not** a trained/validated emotion classifier |
| Inference | Single trained pipeline reused, no fake padding vectors |
| Confidence | SVM margins are shown as **uncalibrated relative scores** |

## Expected output artifacts (only **after Run all**)

`outputs/01_data_distribution.png`, `02_tfidf_category_terms.png`, `03_linguistic_sentiment.png`, `04_ner_analysis.png`, `05_model_cv_comparison.png`, `06_confusion_matrix.png`, `07_entity_comentions.png`, `model_cv_comparison.csv`, `per_class_metrics.csv`, `error_analysis_excerpt.csv`, `insights.json`, `run_manifest.json`, `newsbot_classifier.joblib`.

**No accuracy or macro-F1 number is claimed here prior to execution.** The report and reflection should use numbers directly from `outputs/run_manifest.json` after an approved, successful run.

## Limitations and use policy

Historical single-publisher BBC corpus, not a multilingual/current feed; domain shift unmeasured; NER/semantics imperfect; emotion vocabulary not validated; sentiment can misread quotations or report controversial subjects; document length truncated *for linguistic analyses only*; no automated publication/decision authority. Do not claim this establishes factual truth, live trend monitoring, or perfect performance.

The instructor's `Midterm_NewsBot_Intelligence_System_student.ipynb` provided the module-by-module starter scaffold.

## Optional +5 dashboard opportunity

The included `dashboard.py` can display actual outputs and analyze a pasted article. Run the notebook first, install `streamlit`, and execute `streamlit run dashboard.py` locally. Bonus credit is subject to instructor grading; a script alone does not demonstrate a deployed live dashboard.

## Verified-output report generation

After **Colab Run all** completes on the *instructor-approved* BBC training CSV, download the resulting `outputs/` folder into this project and run:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt reportlab pillow
python generate_final_report.py --group "Solo" --repo "https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY"
```

This creates the required-naming technical report and includes real CV/holdout metrics, actual class precision/recall/F1, sentiment comparisons and actual exported figures. When output files are missing, the script labels the PDF **pre-run draft**, never fabricates results. Confirm your public repository URL before submitting. The separate two-page journal must contain firsthand individual reflections, not invented teamwork. See `QUICK_START_EN.md` and `docs/Submission_Audit_100_Point_Rubric.md`.

## Offline regression tests

Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v` from the project folder. Five test cases currently pass on synthetic fixtures. Results from these fixtures have **no relationship to real BBC model performance** and are never copied into the deliverable outputs. Details: `docs/VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md`. The optional dashboard dependencies are in `requirements-dashboard.txt`.
